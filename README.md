## Introduction
CAPTCHAs‚Äîshort for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart‚Äîare widely used security mechanisms designed to distinguish human users from automated bots. Typically presented as distorted text embedded within an image, CAPTCHAs require users to manually transcribe the characters before gaining access to a website or completing a form. This process serves as a safeguard against automated abuse, such as spam submissions or credential stuffing.

However, advancements in Deep Learning and Computer Vision have challenged the efficacy of traditional CAPTCHA systems. This project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically interpret and solve text-based CAPTCHAs, effectively bypassing their intended security function.

CNNs are a specialized class of deep learning architectures that excel in image processing tasks. By learning hierarchical feature representations, CNNs can extract meaningful patterns from visual data, making them particularly well-suited for tasks such as character recognition in distorted or noisy images. This capability positions CNNs as a powerful tool in the domain of CAPTCHA decoding.

This project aims to defeat text-based CAPTCHA challenges by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically recognize and predict CAPTCHA text.

### The workflow involves:
1. *Dataset preparation & preprocessing*
2. *CNN model architecture design*
3. *Training & evaluation on CAPTCHA samples*
4. *Prediction & testing on unseen CAPTCHA images*

## Dataset Description

## Model Architecture
The CAPTCHA recognition model is a 24-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to predict each character in a 5-character CAPTCHA independently.

### üîπ Overview of Layers
1. *Input Layer* => Accepts grayscale images of size 50√ó200√ó1
2. *Convolutional Layers* => Extracts spatial features from CAPTCHA images and uses multiple filters to detect edges, curves, and patterns
3. *Max Pooling Layers* => Reduces spatial dimensions while keeping important features
4. *Batch Normalization Layer* => Improves model stability and speeds up training
5. *Flatten Layer* => Converts 2D feature maps into a 1D vector for fully connected layers
6. *Dense (Fully Connected) Layers* => Five dense layers connected to flatten output where each dense layer uses ReLU activation
7. *Dropout Layers* => Connected after each dense layer for regularization to prevent overfitting
8. *Output Layers* => Five independent dense layers (one for each character) where each output layer has 36 neurons (26 letters + 10 digits). Uses Sigmoid activation to predict probabilities of each character class.

### üîπ Training Details
